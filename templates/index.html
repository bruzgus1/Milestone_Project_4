                    <h3>Cold Beetroot Soup</h3>
                    <p>Essentially a cold Lithuanian borscht, its a fantastic and iconic soup, especially
                        on warm day. It's very popular in Lithuania. It s sometimes made with kefir instead of yogurt,
                        sour cream, and/or buttermilk. The Soup is great for digestive health. Also, the beets are
                        really the only ingredient that's cooked. Serve with potatoes or bread.</p>
